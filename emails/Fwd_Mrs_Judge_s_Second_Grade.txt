ReadingIELA The students have had such a wonderful start to the school year and our second grade curriculum! Next week we will continue to read and write about school and how we can include everyone when we are learning and playing: We will also continue to discuss what makes a complete sentence and when to use a capital letter:
For phonics, we will be learning about R-controlled E and will practice reading and writing these words We will have weekly spelling words that the students will be quizzed on every Friday: These quizzes are not for a grade; but a way for us to assess whether your child is learning the spelling pattern each week. Please feel free to practice these spelling words at home to support your child!
Judge & Stephan Math: The students had a wonderful time getting to know each other and creating different graphs about their classmates' preferences. We will continue to practice our graphing skills next week as we walk through each of our MATH centers. MATH stands for M- meet the teacher; A-at your seat; T-technology, and H-hands on games  When the students are ready; we will start doing daily center rotations in math Please review the work that is coming home with your child and help reinforce any skills that they ' may need additional support withl

Next week students will be introduced to centers and we will be going over center routines. We will also be practicing even and odd, and greater than and less than Please review any work that is coming home with your child to review any skills that we are working on in the class.
